There are 2 main parts of executables in this repository:

## Ansible

Ansible is used to deploy 4 instances with clustered CouchDB setup. To deploy using the Ansible script we have provided, check our [Ansible README](https://github.com/davidsetyanugraha/c3-assignment2/blob/master/ansible/README.md) for more details.

## UI

The UI is used to visualize the data that we have gathered and analysed. The main application is a SPA (Single Page App), which is built using ReactJS. However, some of the visualizations are generated as a HTML page. Check the [UI README](https://github.com/davidsetyanugraha/c3-assignment2/blob/master/ui/README.md) for more details.
