Modeled on the World Economic Forum\"s Global Competitiveness Report, [In]Sight was developed in collaboration with Deloitte Access Economics and combines data from sources including the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Social Health Atlas of Australia.<br/><br/>Economic conditions determine the quality of the general economic climate in a region. Economic stability is a key factor in ensuring high levels of trust in the market for both consumers and producers. High levels of trust lead to high long term investment rates (by businesses and households), which are an integral component of competitiveness. Conversely, uncertainty acts as a deterrent to investment, thereby decreasing competitiveness.","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"LGA2011","type":"Integer","title":"LGA Code","description":"The ABS code of the LGA","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"State","type":"String","title":"State","description":"The state within which the LGA is located","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"LGA_Name","type":"String","title":"LGA Name","description":"The name of the LGA","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"Econ_SD","type":"Double","title":"Economic Fundamentals Indicator Standard Deviation","description":"The standard deviation of the Economic Fundamentals Indicator, representing how well a LGA is performing relative to a national \"average Australian region\"","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"Econ_Rank","type":"Double","title":"Economic Fundamentals Indicator Ranking","description":"The Rank of the Economic Fundamentals Indicator from 1-560 out of 560 Local Government Areas, based on the Standard Deviation","stype":"ordinal","isDimension":false},{"name":"BuildApp","type":"Double","title":"Value of building approvals (\"000)","description":"The total value of building approvals within the LGA (\"000)","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"ResPop","type":"Double","title":"Resident population","description":"The total resident population for the LGA","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"BA_meas","type":"Double","title":"Building Approvals","description":"Measurement: Value of building approvals per capita (\"000) (Source: ABS Cat 8731.0 - Building Approvals Australia, datacubes )","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"BA_sd","type":"Double","title":"Building approvals Standard Deviation","description":"The standard deviation of the Measure, representing how well a LGA is performing relative to a national \"average Australian region\"","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"BA_rank","type":"Double","title":"Building approvals Ranking","description":"The Rank of the Measure from 1-560 out of 560 Local Government Areas, based on the Standard Deviation","stype":"ordinal","isDimension":false},{"name":"Incm_meas","type":"Double","title":"Wage/labour costs","description":"Measurement: Average wage and salary income (Source: 5673.0.55.003 - Wage and salary earner statistics for small areas, Table 3A)","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"Incm_sd","type":"Double","title":"Wage/labour costs Standard Deviation","description":"The standard deviation of the Measure, representing how well a LGA is performing relative to a national \"average Australian region\"","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"Incm_rank","type":"Double","title":"Wage/labour costs Ranking","description":"The Rank of the Measure from 1-560 out of 560 Local Government Areas, based on the Standard Deviation","stype":"ordinal","isDimension":false},{"name":"BsCI_meas","type":"Double","title":"Business confidence","description":"Measurement: Confidence levels in the prospects of business over the next twelve months (higher rating/measurement, greater business confidence) (Source: Expert Survey)","stype":"ordinal","isDimension":false},{"name":"BsCI_sd","type":"Double","title":"Business confidence Standard Deviation","description":"The standard deviation of the Measure, representing how well a LGA is performing relative to a national \"average Australian region\"","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"BsCI_rank","type":"Double","title":"Business confidence Ranking","description":"The Rank of the Measure from 1-560 out of 560 Local Government Areas, based on the Standard Deviation","stype":"ordinal","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","feature":{"key":"LGA2011","geoLevel":"lga2011","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[140.961681984,-39.159189527500004,149.976679008,-33.9806475865],"featureType":"ste","featureInstance":"2","featureName":"Victoria","referenceSystemIdentifier":"EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":["2"]}}
